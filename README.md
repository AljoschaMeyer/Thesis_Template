# Template for Bachelor and Master Theses at ODS, TU Berlin

This repository provides very simple starting points for the tex code of your thesis proposal ("Expos√©") at [`proposal.tex`](./proposal.tex) and the actual thesis at [`main.tex`](./main.tex). Just clone the repository to get started. You will have to learn LaTeX elsewhere though.

It is *not mandatory* to use this template when writing your thesis at [ODS](https://www.tu.berlin/ods/studium-lehre/abschlussarbeiten), this is merely a convenient option for getting started quickly.

## Important

This repository contains a [license file](./LICENSE) that waives all copyright. That is by intention, everyone should be free to use this template in whichever way they see fit. You should **replace the LICENSE file** with whichever license suits your thesis best. Or you can keep the file and put your thesis into the public domain of course (I, for example, [did exactly that](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/master_thesis)).
